# Tution Fees Manager

This is a personal project which incorporates a help of maintaining the records of fee payments of the students studying in the coaching or tution classes. This can also be useful for those who want to keep track of their student's fee payment details. This application simply aims towards turning a payment regulation register into a digital web based application.

This is a very simple application and has no complicated usage methods. Especially designed for those who are non IT field persons and looking towards a better and clean way to maintain their institutional transactions.

### Note :
* This application is currently a web based application created using the nodeJS framework powered by express.js.
* This app can be launched only on local networks and can be accessed by the devices connected on the local network only.
* Further modifications will be made for either making this app globally accessible with user account based encrypted login system or else it will be converted into a native application that can be run on mobile as well as desktop based devices.

### For contributions:
* Modify whatever you feel like would make a new feature to the app, and then push it to the forked repo making a branch other than main (to avoid conflicting). Then, start a pull request.
* Also, when modifiying, add your name below with the respective github or any git service profile link.
